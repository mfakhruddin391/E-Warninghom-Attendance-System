# E-Warninghom-Attendence-System
E-warningHOM is an Attendence System for secondary and Primary Schools. HOM is stands for (Hijau(Green),Oren(Orange),Merah(Red)) "the name was given by my teachers :p maybe a little bit wierd but its sounds like a cool things isn't? :P . E-warninghom platform is web-based that fully running on a web browser. the reason i created this system is to take student attendence alot more easier and better than traditional way which is using a paper and Attendence book.
